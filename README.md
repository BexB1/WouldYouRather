# Welcome to WouldYouRather..?

This is a simple A/B polling app built in React and Redux.

As a User, you can log in and ask a new question. Upon voting on a question, you can view the statistics of a question, including where your vote falls in the breakdown of user answers. Lastly, there is a leaderboard, where you can compete for a points total of questions asked and answered.

## Getting started

The app is built in `create-react-app`.

1. Install the necessary npm packages with npm install on the command line.
2. Run the development server with npm start.
